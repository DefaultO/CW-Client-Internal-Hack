# CW-Client-Internal-Hack
*A mono internal hack made public for learning purposes. One of my long-term projects I actually used myself. You can find more information related to this in my release thread: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unity/399229-contract-wars-internal-hack.html*

The contents from the "Pasted" Folder are from a leaked / dumped [EFT Cheat](https://github.com/SeriouslyDoge/Eft-pasta). It contains only drawing classes I thought I could use in the future. They are fine, but are rather for newer Unity Versions. You can make the Chams Universal for any Unity Game, if you use your own Shader. I was too lazy to add my own Ressources to the game. You can read more about how to do it in here: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/unity/388964-advanced-unity-hacking-techniques-methods-adding-custom-assets.html

There might be easier methods, like loading a Shader from a byte array you hardcoded or you get from your server using **AssetBundle.LoadFromMemory**, but those are proven to work and the methods contain steps that are easy to follow.
